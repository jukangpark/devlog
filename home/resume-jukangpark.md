### **About Me**

Hello, I am a frontend developer with 3 years of experience, primarily focused on React. I have successfully developed three in-house open-source projects, a personal service (Deskify), and two major products for my company. While I prioritize personal growth, I place an even higher value on the growth of the company and the team. To this end, I actively share my technical insights through YouTube lectures and a tech blog. I also believe that efficient development practices lead to better results, which is why I’ve led the creation of contributing and convention documents, fostering a voluntary code review culture among the in-house developers. I am always eager to contribute proactively to the growth and success of the team.
